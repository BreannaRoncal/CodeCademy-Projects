    <h1>Flexbox vs Grid Reference Sheet</h1>
    <h2>When to use which one</h2>
    <p><strong>Flexbox</strong> is more one-dimensional, item layout is either horizontal or vertical. The widths/heights of the flex items are determined by their content, it grows or shrinks depending on the content and the available space. So, it's good for responsive websites.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Grid</strong> is two-dimensional with a main axis and a cross axis where you can place items into cells defined by rows and columns. The placement of items is precisely controlled, but the content does not grow or shrink.
