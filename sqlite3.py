SQLite3

Congratulations! You have completed your journey through database operations with Python. Let’s reflect on everything we have learned in this lesson:

  - SQL, which stands for Structured Query Language, is a programming language designed to manage data stored in relational databases.
  - Once you pull the SQLite data into your Python environment, you can analyze, visualize, change, and test this data.
  - You may also edit a new or pre-existing SQLite database directly from a Python environment by connecting to the database using the sqlite3.connect() API.
  - In a database, a cursor allows us to traverse over the data one row at a time to call statements and return data. We can create a cursor object using the .cursor() method.
  - Using the .execute() method in combination with a CREATE clause, we can create a table within the SQLite database.
  - Using the .execute() method and an INSERT clause, we can insert data into a pre-existing table.
  - To insert multiple rows/records of data at once, we can use the .executemany() method.
  - To retrieve SQLite data, we can use the fetch methods; .fetchone(), .fetchmany(), and .fetchall().
  - A Python for loop can be used to retrieve SQLite data. It can also be used to analyze already pulled data.
  - After making changes to the SQLite database, we must commit the changes using the .commit() method.
  - When we finish editing the SQLite database commit the changes, we can use the .close() method to close the database connection.

# Import module sqlite3
import sqlite3

# Create connection object
con = sqlite3.connect('titanic.db')

# Create cursor object
curs = con.cursor()

# Retrieve the row where username = 'stephB423'; from new_table
n_row = curs.execute('''SELECT * FROM new_table
                WHERE username = "stephB423"
                    ''').fetchone()

# Close the connection
con.commit()
con.close()
