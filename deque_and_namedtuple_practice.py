Deque and Named Tuple
How to Use:
  from collections import deque and namedtuple
  - Deque: an advanced container which is optimized for appending and popping items from the front and back. 
  - Named Tuple: the namedtuple lets us create an immutable data structure similar to a tuple, but we donâ€™t have to 
    access the stored data using indices. Instead, we can create instances of our namedtuple with named attributes. 
    We can then use the . operator to retrieve data by the attribute names.
    
Goal:
  - The final addition to our clothes store app will be some logic for bundling overstocked items into groups to sell at once. 
  - We would like to split our items by price and then pick three cheaper items and two more expensive items per bundle. 
  - Finally, we are going to promote the bundles which have a value greater than 100 dollars.
