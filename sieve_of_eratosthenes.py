The Sieve of Eratosthenes

The sieve provides a set of steps for finding all prime numbers up to a given
limit. In this article, weâ€™ll cover implementing the Sieve of Eratosthenes in
Python. As a reminder, a prime number is a positive number with no divisors
but 1 and itself. 2, 3, 11, and 443 are all prime numbers.


    1. Create a list of all integers from 2 to n.
    2. Start with the smallest number in the list (2, the smallest prime number).
    3. Mark all multiples of that number up to n as not prime.
    4. Move to the next non-marked number and repeat this process until the
       entire list has been covered.
