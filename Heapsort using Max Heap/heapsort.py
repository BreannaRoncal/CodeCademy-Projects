Heapsort in Python

Letâ€™s go over what we learned about heapsort:

  1. A heapsort algorithm uses the heap data structure to organize data.
  2. The first step to implement heapsort is to place the data inside a heap.
  3. While the heap has more than one element, extract the largest value in the heap by swapping it with the right-most child and then removing it.
  4. After we swap the root value and the last value, we must restructure the heap until every parent has a larger value than their children again.
